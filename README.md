# BookApp - LitRate

## Introduction
Welcome to the LitRate project! This application is developed for the imaginary LitRate bookstore to manage their book inventory and provide a seamless experience for users to explore, rate, and save books.
In this project, the primary objective is to acquire knowledge and skills related to the utilization of a headless Content Management System (CMS).

## Features
### Admin
- The admin can access the CMS interface to upload books.
- Each book must include a title, author, page count, release date, cover image, and initial average rating (set to 0 when a book is uploaded).
- Admin can select from at least two different color themes for the website.

### Logged-Out Mode
- Users can register and log in.
- Users can view all books and their details available in the API.
  
### Logged-In Mode
- Users have a personal profile page with their username. 
- Users have the option to log out.
- Users can rate books.
- The user's profile page includes a list of all books they have rated, sortable by title, author, and rating (alphabetical for title and author, highest to lowest for rating).
